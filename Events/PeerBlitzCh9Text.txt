[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x04][0x01]
Miladysir your highness![A][NL]
Those are the dreaded monk-pirates[NL]
of <somewhere>![A][NL]
Their unparalleled faith give them[NL]
the most potent light magic in all 6 seas![A][NL]

... Armoured knights?[A][NL]

[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x04][0x01]
Miladysir your highness![A][NL]
Those are the dreaded armoured pirates[NL]
of <somewhere else>![A][NL]
Their amazingly thick armor makes for[NL]
the sturdiest defense in all 6 seas![A][NL]

[OpenMidLeft]
Yet somehow their ship[NL]
doesn't sink...[A][NL]
I'll... tell the others[NL]
to take caution.[A][NL]

Their stunningly fast mounts gives them[NL]
the best land mobility in all 6 seas![A][NL]

Land mobility...[A] at sea.[A][NL]
Somehow it doesn't feel as threatning[NL]

Miladysir your highness![A][NL]
Those are the dreaded flying pirates[NL]
of <somewhere else again>![A][NL]
Their winged mounts warrants them the[NL]
best raiding potential in all 6 seas![A][NL]

[OpenMidLeft]
But...[A] pegasi are usually so frail it takes[NL]
no less than an arrow to take them down.[A][NL]
I think I also question the need[NL]
for them to travel by boat...[A][NL]
It feels like it would be rather cumbersome...[A][NL]
